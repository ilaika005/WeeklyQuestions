After working at a Library, Moshe wants to play a game with his good friend, Jacob. There are N boxes numbered from 1 to N. The i-th box contains i books. Jacob and Moshe will play a game using those boxes.

There will be N turns numbered from 1 to N. On each turn, Jacob chooses one box and takes all books from that box, then Moshe does the same thing for one box he chooses (it is possible that the two chosen boxes are the same).

Given an integer M. Before the game begins, Moshe must choose an integer K satisfying 1≤K≤M. It is known that on the j-th turn, Jacob will choose the j-th box, while Moshe will choose the y-th box, with y=((j×K−1)modN)+1. Help Moshe choose the correct value of K so that he will get as many books as possible! If there are more than one possible values of K that result in the maximum total books, find the minimum such value of K.

Keep in mind that each box can be chosen more than once, but after a box is chosen for the first time, the box becomes empty.

Input:
The only line contains two integers N and M (1≤N≤10^9; 1≤M≤2000) — the number of boxes and the maximum limit for the value of K.

Output:
An integer representing the value of K that will make Moshe get as many books as possible. If there are more than one possible value of K that result in the maximum total books, find the minimum such value of K.

Happy coding and behatzlacha for everyone!

In the first example, if Moshe chooses K=1, the game will go as follows:

Jacob chooses the 1-st box and gets 1 book, then Moshe chooses the 1-st box and gets 0 books.
Jacob chooses the 2-nd box and gets 2 books, then Moshe chooses the 2-nd box and gets 0 books.
Jacob chooses the 3-rd box and gets 3 books, then Moshe chooses the 3-rd box and gets 0 books.
In total, Moshe gets 0+0+0=0 books.

The maximum total books that can be earned by Moshe is 0 because he can only choose K=1. Therefore, K=1 is the minimum possible value of K that results in the maximum total books.

In the second example, if Moshe chooses K=3, the game will go as follows:

Jacob chooses the 1-st box and gets 1 book, then Moshe chooses the 3-rd box and gets 3 books.
Jacob chooses the 2-nd box and gets 2 books, then Moshe chooses the 1-st box and gets 0 books.
Jacob chooses the 3-rd box and gets 0 books, then Moshe chooses the 4-th box and gets 4 books.
Jacob chooses the 4-th box and gets 0 books, then Moshe chooses the 2-nd box and gets 0 books.
Jacob chooses the 5-th box and gets 5 books, then Moshe chooses the 5-th box and gets 0 books.
In total, Moshe gets 3+0+4+0+0=7 books.

It can be obtained that 7 is the maximum total books that can be earned by Moshe. The possible values of K that result in 7 total books are 3 and 4. Therefore, K=3 is the minimum possible value of K that results in the maximum total books.
